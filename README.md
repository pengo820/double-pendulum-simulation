# double-pendulum-simulation
In this project, I simulated the motion of a double pendulum (a typical example of chaotic pendulum) using python. 
By slightly changing the initial conditions of the pendulum (variables) ,such as mass, angle subtendedï¼Œand string length, we could find huge difference in the motion, especially when the energy of the pendulum gradually increased.

Below is a screenshot of the result after running **doublependulum.py** :
